            <span class="text-bold">Adobe Photoshop</span> is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows.
            Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. Since then, it has become the de facto industry
            standard in raster graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a verb as in "to Photoshop an image," 
            "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though Adobe discourages such use.
